    Architecture Design Agent:
    This agent generates detailed architecture representations based on analyzed requirements.
    It performs the following steps:
      1. Generates a detailed plain-text flowchart outlining the development process.
      2. Produces a comprehensive plain-text component diagram that defines system components and their interactions.
      3. Creates a structured blueprint of system components.
      4. Generates a high-level code skeleton to serve as a starting point for implementation.
      5. Decomposes the architecture into logical modules.
      6. Designs a data model that underpins the system.
      7. Specifies interfaces for module communication.
      8. Analyzes security and performance aspects.
      9. Provides a comprehensive technical roadmap.
    All outputs are formatted as JSON objects.
