      {
        "technology": "JavaScript",
        "reason": "JavaScript is prevalent in front-end web development and is used in many of the example projects and code samples. It's essential for creating a dynamic and interactive user interface for the task management application.  Many code examples showcase JavaScript's use with local storage for data persistence and authentication."
      },
      {
        "technology": "React",
        "reason": "The presence of React code samples (e.g., `TaskForm.js`) suggests a React-based front-end would be efficient and leverage readily available components. This aligns with the project's scope of a simple, yet functional, application."
      },
      {
        "technology": "HTML",
        "reason": "HTML is the fundamental building block of web pages, and is essential for structuring the user interface.  The examples show Handlebars (a templating engine that uses HTML) and plain HTML, both of which would be useful in constructing the application's views."
      },
      {
        "technology": "CSS",
        "reason": "CSS is crucial for styling and visual presentation of the application's user interface, ensuring an appealing and user-friendly experience. While no specific CSS examples are provided, its inclusion is standard practice in web development."
      },
      {
        "technology": "Local Storage (Browser)",
        "reason": "Based on the documentation and code examples, local storage is a suitable choice for data persistence, as the application is designed to be a simple local web application. This approach avoids the complexity of setting up a backend database for a small-scale task manager.  The provided examples heavily leverage this method."
      },
      {
        "technology": "Node.js (Optional)",
        "reason": "While a basic application can be built without a backend, Node.js could be optionally used to handle more complex features if needed.  The placeholder Node.js code sample indicates potential for future extension to include server-side logic for user authentication or data management, but it is not strictly required for MVP."
      },
      {
        "technology": "Python (Optional)",
        "reason": "Similar to Node.js, Python is an optional choice if a backend is required for more sophisticated features. The Python code sample suggests it may be used for database interactions if necessary in the future, but is not essential for MVP."
